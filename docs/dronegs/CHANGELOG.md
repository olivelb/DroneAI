# DroneGS changelog

This changelog covers the standalone Gaussian trainer project.

## 0.3.0 - Phase 2

- Added a validated backend-neutral training request and normalized result.
- Added LichtFeld and contract-v1 DroneGS subprocess adapters.
- Kept LichtFeld as the default while adding explicit environment and mission selection.
- Wired the existing partitioned orthophoto workflow through the backend boundary.
- Documented the pinned LichtFeld CLI's lack of user-controlled seed support.

## 0.2.0 - Phase 1

- Added a versioned, backend-neutral benchmark suite format.
- Added isolated repeated runs with immutable output directories.
- Added dataset inventory fingerprints and PLY artifact validation.
- Added wall-time summaries and best-effort per-process VRAM sampling.
- Added the five-run GAJAN LichtFeld reference suite.

## 0.1.0 - Phase 0

- Defined the product boundary between DroneAI and its Gaussian trainer.
- Versioned the initial CLI and run-manifest contracts.
- Added the implementation roadmap and phase gates.

The production backend remains LichtFeld until all parity gates pass.
